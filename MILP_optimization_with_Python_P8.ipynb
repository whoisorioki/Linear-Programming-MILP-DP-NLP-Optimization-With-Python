    "a. OR-tools solver:\n",
    "\n",
    "Results of the first and second scenario where IR8 cannot be grown on Field Type I are indeed identical. The unchanged solution when adding the constraint that IR8 cannot be grown in Field I suggests two things: firstly, that the restriction aligns with the optimal planting strategy derived without it, and secondly, it could indicate a potential area of focus for further investigation like planting strategy, costs, or yields could change this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions provided by the LP and MILP techniques are different. Here is the insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "Allocation of Rice Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- IR8: The LP solution does not utilize IR8 in Field II and uses all 25 hectares in Field III. In contrast, the MILP solution fully utilizes Field II for IR8 planting, which suggests different optimization dynamics between integer constraints (MILP) and continuous variables (LP).\n",
    "    \n",
    "- IR132: The LP solution has a significant allocation of IR132 in Field II (20 hectares), which is not present in the MILP solution. This again reflects the flexibility in continuous allocation in LP that might not be as effective or feasible when restricted to integer values in MILP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Field Utilization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Field II in LP has only IR132 planted and utilizes only 20 out of 25 possible hectares, indicating a potentially suboptimal use of available land under the constraints and yield assumptions of LP.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Field III shows differing allocations between IR8 and IR132 across the solutions, which might indicate that the profitability or yield per hectare changes dramatically based on how the constraints are treated (integer vs. continuous).\n",
    "\n",
    "b. CPLEX solver:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The optimal value reached is 585.0, which represents the maximum total yield based on your model's constraints and objective function.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Rice IR132 is heavily allocated to Field I, which might indicate it's the most profitable or effective use of that field, while rice CBC is primarily allocated to Field II, with Rice IR8 also placed significantly in Field III and minimally in Field II.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- The results are reasonable and align with typical outcomes in agricultural optimization, where certain crops are prioritized in specific fields to optimize the use of available resources and meet demand constraints effectively.\n",
    "  \n",
    "c. LP vs. MILP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- LP offers more flexibility in how variables can be allocated, potentially allowing for more \"fine-tuned\" solutions at a fractional level, which might not always be practical or feasible in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- MILP provides solutions that are more practical for real-world applications where the decision variables must be whole numbers (like the number of hectares that can realistically be planted).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Depending on the exact nature of the constraints and objective function, MILP might yield a less optimal solution in terms of the raw numbers but a more feasible and practically implementable solution.\n"
